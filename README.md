This is both a library for generating names as well as one for collecting data about names.

## Name Generation

Access the API-Class to generate names based on the default data. Length and Letter positioning are based on the data previously collected.
Further names can be supplied as a list or one by one during runtime.

## Data Collection

While not intened for production use, it is possible to parse your own name lists, generating more data about letter combinations and their rarity. Have a look at the main Method of the API class for that.

## Future Plans

Further expanding of the name generation by allowing multiple locations to be chosen between randomly.
